# FnafEditor
This is a lightweight tool to modify your FNaF saves. I made this because I didn't know what else to do. This is a work in progress!

## How To Build
You need:
- Visual Studio 2022 version from June or later
- .NET 8.0, and the .NET desktop development workload in VS
- Basic computer knowledge

Steps:
- Download the source code. There is a green "Code" button in the top right corner in GitHub. Click it, and click "Download Zip" (easiest way)
- Extract the .zip you just downloaded. Open the "src" folder, then open the .sln file in Visual Studio.
- Make your desired changes, if any. This tutorial will NOT be covering Visual Basic, .NET, or WinForms.
- Click Build > Build Solution.
- Your executable will be available at "src/FnafEditorVB/bin/Debug/net8.0-windows/FnafEditorVB.exe", if you compiled with Debug. If you compiled for Release, it will be at "src/FnafEditorVB/bin/Release/net8.0-windows/FnafEditorVB.exe"
